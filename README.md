# thrashMetal_lyrics_comparison
Looking at the careers of thrash metal bands Sepultura (Brazil), Megadeth (USA) and Sodom (Germany) and analyzing their lyrics.

Have you ever wondered how your favourite artistsâ€™ lyrical content differs? Do all of them focus on romance? Maybe one of them has a nihilistic point of view and encourages you to live life to the fullest without worrying too much about the moral ambiguity of the world around you? Perhaps that artist you never truly cared for brings up political notions once too many times?
This guide will provide you with the tools in Python and corresponding explanations so you can find out the answers to the aforementioned questions, and more!
